# What is this?

This project provides a LaTeX class aiming to implement the style sheet of the
Cascadilla Proceedings Project
([http://www.lingref.com/cpp/authors/style.html]).

# Who is this for?

If you are writing a paper for proceedings published by the Cascadilla
Proceedings Project and you use XeLaTeX and biblatex, you will hopefully be
able to submit a properly typeset version using this class.

There is an existing LaTeX-class for Cascadilla proceedings, Max Bane's
`cascadilla.cls` ([https://github.com/maxbane/cascadilla.cls/]). If you
use (pdf)LaTeX and natbib/bibtex, that's what you're looking for.

Personally, I am using this to write a paper for the proceedings of [WCCFL
2020][https://wccfl2020.linguistics.ubc.ca/] and I'll be fixing any issues that
I come across in the process. Thus, there is no proof (yet) or guarantee that
a paper typeset using this class will be accepted, but that's the aim.
